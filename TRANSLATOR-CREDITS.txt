A lot of time and effort goes into Nucleus and it couldn't be done without the help of a lot of people. For the code, 
the commit history has the contributors, and I encourage people to look at the contributors in Github for those.

We also have people who have stepped up to the plate and translated for us, and these people do not show up in the contributors
(mostly). I will try to keep up with who is involved here, thank you for your time!
