## New Features

### Enhanced Warnings on login for those with wildcard permissions

We get a lot of questions about vanish on login and using the `*`/`nucleus` permission wildcard. We now display a warning upon login
for any user with the `nucleus` permission. This can be disabled in `main.conf` under `check-for-wildcard` if your setup is intended.  

### Added `OWNER` suggested permission set

`/nucleus setupperms` now has an `OWNER` role that gives all permission EXCEPT for those that provide exemptions that are generally not wanted
in most cases. The documentation pages will be updated in due course

## Minor Adjustments

* `/kit` and `/kits` permissions are now suggested as `USER` permissions, not `ADMIN`. Kit control is now down with the `nucleus.kits.<kitname>` 
permissions, these being `ADMIN` permissions is now redundant
* Removed FastClasspathScanner from dependencies as it is not used any more
* Updated QSML to 0.10.1

## Bugfixes

* Fixed typos in `setupperms`  - thanks to Luck for spotting these issues
* Fixed logic issue when creating a world with a seed - thanks to Minecrell for spotting the issue
* Prevent NPE when deserialising certain kits
* Fix not being able to replace tokens in kits
* Try to enforce disabling the whitelist on the client in case it is accidentally enabled (it should never be enabled)
