## New Features

### Enhanced `Warnings on login for those with wildcard permissions`

We get a lot of questions about vanish on login and using the `*`/`nucleus` permission wildcard. We now display a warning upon login
for any user with the `nucleus` permission. This can be disabled in `main.conf` under `check-for-wildcard` if your setup is intended.  

## Minor Adjustments

* `/kit` and `/kits` permissions are now suggested as `USER` permissions, not `ADMIN`. Kit control is now down with the `nucleus.kits.<kitname>` 
permissions, these being `ADMIN` permissions is now redundant

## Bugfixes

* Fixed typos in `setupperms`  - thanks to Luck for spotting these issues
