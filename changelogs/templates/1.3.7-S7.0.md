## Advisory: Update to 1.3.7 if you are running 1.3.5

If you are using 1.3.5 please update to 1.3.7 ASAP. There is a potential issue with `setupperms` that could allow
someone to incorrectly assign inherited permissions (the ladder in my code was upside down, so assigning admin perms could
have ended up with ADMIN and NONE permissions being assigned, rather than ADMIN, MOD and USER).

Do not use `setupperms` until you have updated to 1.3.7
