Nucleus 1.4 is less of a feature release but more of a codebase refresh release. This is to allow us to prepare of changes anticipated in API 8,
which will be Minecraft 1.13.

The main goal for this release was to perform some cleanup. This is to add consistency to the codebase to allow for easier updates going forward

## Important Information

After much thought, 1.4.x will be the last release series line to contain the following modules within Nucleus itself:

_to be announced after completion of modules review_

They are not widely used by the community and are not generally maintained within the Nucleus system. Nucleus' goal is to provide an essential 
base of small, useful utilities, not a "kitchen sink", and these modules have fallen into the latter.
 
However, these modules will be split into their own plugins in the coming weeks and months and released separately on Ore for those of you 
finding these modules useful. They will contain automatic data migration systems from Nucleus.

The modules will be deleted no later than Nucleus 2.0
