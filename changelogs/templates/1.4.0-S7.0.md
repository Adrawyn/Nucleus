Nucleus 1.4 is less of a feature release but more of a codebase refresh release. This is to allow us to prepare of changes anticipated in API 8,
which will be Minecraft 1.13.

The main goal for this release was to perform some cleanup. This is to add consistency to the codebase to allow for easier updates going forward

## Important Information

After much thought, the following modules within Nucleus will be removed at some point in the future:

_to be announced after completion of modules review_

They are not widely used by the community and are not generally maintained within the Nucleus system. Nucleus' goal is to provide an essential 
base of small, useful utilities, not a "kitchen sink", and these modules have fallen into the latter.
 
However, these modules will be split into their own plugins in the coming weeks and months and released separately on Ore for those of you 
finding these modules useful. They will contain automatic data migration systems from Nucleus.

The modules will be deleted no later than Nucleus 2.0

## New Features

### Added block information to `/blockzap`

Thanks to TheFlash787 on his first contribution, he has added the item name into messages when a block is removed via this command

### Added `/kit rename` and associated API method

You can now rename your kits

### `/tpn` now accepts tab completion

As title, Nucleus now properly aliases the `/minecraft:tp` command rather than acting as a pass through

### Added `/commandinfo`

Allows for inspection of a command, who owns it, and what description it has.

## Removed `/kit command edit` Inventory GUI in favour of the text GUI

It didn't really work, and with books not working fully as intended, it's better to remove the feature (at least for now)

## Remove enchantments using the `/enchant` command

Setting an enchantment to level 0 will remove the enchantment in question from the item in your hand 

## Minor updates

* Add some aliases for existing commands
  * Jail module: /setjail, /deljail
  * Item naming: /setitemname, /resetitemname
* `/tppos` now accepts decimal co-ordinates.

## Bugfixes

* Fix permission on /home limit
* Fix chat template default having a leading space when no prefix is defined
* Fix edge case where an extraordinary number of warps will cause a server hang on tab complete
* Prevent NPEs when trying to write messages when the social spy template is empty

## API updates

There are no API updates in this release
