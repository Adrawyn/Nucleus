## New Features

### Added `/enderchest` support for offline players

Now you can inspect enderchests of offline players, thanks to recent updates in Sponge. You must have the `nucleus.enderchest.offline`
permission, and you must be using a recent version of Sponge. Nucleus will tell you if the version you are using is too old.

### Updated `/speed` command

You may now reset a users' speed by using the "reset" string in place of a speed. The description for the command
has also been updated.

### Added ability to exempt some worlds from "spawn on login"

You can now mark worlds as exempt from the spawn on login action, that is, if a player logs into an exempt world, 
they will not be moved to the spawn point if the spawn on login feature is enabled.  

## Bugfixes

* Fix incorrect spawn login exemption permission in config comment
* Fix global spawn settings taking players out of jails on login (players will now always be reset to the jail point on login)
