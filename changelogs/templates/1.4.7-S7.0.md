## New Features

### Added `/enderchest` support for offline players

Now you can inspect enderchests of offline players, thanks to recent updates in Sponge. You must have the `nucleus.enderchest.offline`
permission, and you must be using a recent version of Sponge. Nucleus will tell you if the version you are using is too old.

## Bugfixes

* Fix incorrect spawn login exemption permission in config comment
