## New Features

### Added `/enderchest` support for offline players

Now you can inspect enderchests of offline players, thanks to recent updates in Sponge. You must have the `nucleus.enderchest.offline`
permission, and you must be using a recent version of Sponge. Nucleus will tell you if the version you are using is too old.

### Updated `/speed` command

You may now reset a users' speed by using the "reset" string in place of a speed. The description for the command
has also been updated.

## Bugfixes
