## Important Updates

### Removal of GeoIP

GeoIP has been removed from the core Nucleus package. For this functionality, download Nucleus Heisenberg instead.

### Translations!

Nucleus now has the following translations:

* English (en_GB) - default
* Simplified Chinese (zh_CN)

Other languages have been **machine translated** using Microsoft's Azure Cognitive Text system to assist with translation. If you
wish to help with the translation effort, [you can use our translation system](https://translate.nucleuspowered.org). [For more information
about how to translate, see our page on the docs](https://nucleuspowered.org/docs/translation/).

# New Features

## Updated `/seen` command
 
 I've now added per-item permissions for the `/seen` command - that is, you can now finely tune who sees whether an IP address or player
 UUID is shown, for example. They all start with `nucleus.seen.extended`, and will be listed on the permission reference page.
 
 You can also click on the IP address to run `/getfromip`, if you so wish.

# Bugfixes

* Fix seen always showing a player is never AFK.
