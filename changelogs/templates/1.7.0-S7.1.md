## Important Updates

### Removal of GeoIP

GeoIP has been removed from the core Nucleus package. For this functionality, download Nucleus Heisenberg instead.

# New Features

## Updated `/seen` command
 
 I've now added per-item permissions for the `/seen` command - that is, you can now finely tune who sees whether an IP address or player
 UUID is shown, for example. They all start with `nucleus.seen.extended`, and will be listed on the permission reference page.
 
 You can also click on the IP address to run `/getfromip`, if you so wish.

## Added `/extinguish`

This allows for players who are on fire to not be on fire!

# Bugfixes

* Fix seen always showing a player is never AFK.
* Fix RTP cooldown issues
