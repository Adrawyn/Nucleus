# New Features

## \[API] Added `NucleusTextTemplateEvent`

This event is fired when a `NucleusTextTemplate` is sent to command sources. If the originator is the 
broadcast or plain broadcast commands, this event will be `NucleusTextTemplate.Broadcast`. 

## \[API] Relaxed requirements for the cause for the Home events

They used to require the `PluginContainer` at the root, now they don't.

# Bugfixes

* Fix class cast exception when using some chat plugins in combination with Nucleus
