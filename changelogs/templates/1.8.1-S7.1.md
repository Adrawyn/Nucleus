# IMPORTANT: Updates to the Kit storage

An issue with the way we store data using Sponge's config library meant that some kits would not store all NBT data correctly. This includes chests that contains items ([see the issue #1296 on Github](https://github.com/NucleusPowered/Nucleus/issues/1296)). This version works around the original issue, but any kits that have already suffered from this data loss will need to be recreated - we cannot reliably repair those. 
 
Kits that are not affected do not need to be recreated.

# Config Updates

* Renamed the following config keys in the AFK module (these will migrate automatically)
  * `afktime` to `afk-time`
  * `afktimetokick` to `afk-time-to-kick`
  * `afk-when-vanished` to `broadcast-afk-when-vanished` (also clarified the comment on the config)

# Minor Changes

* Added AFK message in console when a player's AFK status is not being broadcasted.

# Bugfixes

* Fixed some data not being properly saved to kit items (such as item data)
