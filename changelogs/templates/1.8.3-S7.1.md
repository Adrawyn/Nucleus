# Minor updates

* Added `core.enable-partial-name-matching` config options to disable partial matching with nickname arguments.
* URLs in warnings and notes are now clickable.
* Added config option for charges when using `/tpa` to be refunded if the request is denied or times out (`teleport.refund-on-deny`).

# API updates

* Added `getRTPService()` static method to the `NucleusAPI` class.

# Bugfixes

* Fixed tab completion on usernames where the starting string is blank
* Fix `/list` causing client disconnections when calling with many players
* Fix a buggy check in the unique user counter
* Fixed charges never being refunded for `/tpa` (turned into a config option, if you want this fix, set `teleport.refund-on-deny` to `true`)
