# New User Preference Service

The User Preference Service is a centralised way for users and admins to set and view preferences set in the Nucleus system.
Currently, only boolean keys are setup for the following preferences:

* Command Spy toggle
* Social Spy toggle
* Teleport toggle
* Private Message Receiving Enabled 
* Powertool toggle
* Vanish on Login toggle

Apart from the vanish on login toggle, nothing has changed from a users' perspective. The Vanish on Login toggle currently
defaults to _true_ as that is the current behaviour. This will default to _false_ in a future version of Nucleus.

Users and admins can use the `/userprefs` command to view and set their own, or other's (if permission is granted), preferences.
This allows for quicker troubleshooting by admin, and simpler accessing of preferences by users.

Plugins can access the standard Nucleus preference keys and obtain the current preferences of users through the 
`NucleusUserPreferenceService`, allowing for harmonisation of, for example, teleport toggling.
